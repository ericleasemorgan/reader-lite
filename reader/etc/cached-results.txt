Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge.
con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her.
These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.
A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might possibly object to it.
And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law.
Who's to doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?
