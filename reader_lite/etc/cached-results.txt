I have travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways.
My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not to live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to transact some private business with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from accomplishing which for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and business talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.
I have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not solely on account of the railroad and the ice trade; it offers advantages which it may not be good policy to divulge; it is a good port and a good foundation.
" When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least as well off as the other classes, I find that for the most part they have been toiling twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become the real owners of their farms, which commonly they have inherited with encumbrances, or else bought with hired moneyand we may regard one third of that toil as the cost of their houses-
I doubt if there are three such men in Concord.
I intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street in Concord in grandeur and luxury, as soon as it pleases me as much and will cost me no more than my present one.
At Cambridge College the mere rent of a student's room, which is only a little larger than my own, is thirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the advantage of building thirty-two side by side and under one roof, and the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the fourth story.
Those conveniences which the student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides.
Even the poor student studies and is taught only political economy, while that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed in our colleges.
I was more independent than any farmer in Concord, for I was not anchored to a house or farm, but could follow the bent of my genius, which is a very crooked one, every moment.
Every New Englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this land of rye and Indian corn, and not depend on distant and fluctuating markets for them.
Yet so far are we from simplicity and independence that, in Concord, fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops, and hominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any.
I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant horizon.
What does our Concord culture amount to?
Even the college-bred and so-called liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little or no acquaintance with the English classics; and as for the recorded wisdom of mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible to all who will know of them, there are the feeblest efforts anywhere made to become acquainted with them.
I aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our Concord soil has produced, whose names are hardly known here.
Moreover, with wisdom we shall learn liberality.
We have a comparatively decent system of common schools, schools for infants only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter, and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the State, no school for ourselves.
It is time that we had uncommon schools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women.
It is time that villages were universities, and their elder inhabitants the fellows of universities, with leisureif they are, indeed, so well offto pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives.
Cannot students be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of Concord?
New England can hire all the wise men in the world to come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be provincial at all.
That is the uncommon school we want.
All our Concord waters have two colors at least; one when viewed at a distance, and another, more proper, close at hand.
It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears in her coronet.
These, with Concord River, are my water privileges; and night and day, year in year out, they grind such grist as I carry to them.
" I thought of living there before I went to Walden.
Shall we to the Concord?
Concord Fight!
But this small village, germ of something more, why did it fail while Concord keeps its ground?
I took this course when I went to lecture in Lincoln in the evening, travelling in no road and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room.
And yet, if you had a discriminating ear, there were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard.
