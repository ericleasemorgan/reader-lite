I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart, with a free circulation, than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and breathe a malaria all the way.
And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season?
Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in.
I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars.
Talk of heaven!
The gods must be proud, thought I, with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman.
"Do you ever fish?"
Go fish and hunt far and wide day by dayfarther and widerand rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides without misgiving.
I speak of fishing only now, for I had long felt differently about fowling, and sold my gun before I went to the woods.
He goes thither at first as a hunter and fisher, until at last, if he has the seeds of a better life in him, he distinguishes his proper objects, as a poet or naturalist it may be, and leaves the gun and fish-pole behind.
I have found repeatedly, of late years, that I cannot fish without falling a little in self-respect.
I have skill at it, and, like many of my fellows, a certain instinct for it, which revives from time to time, but always when I have done I feel that it would have been better if I had not fished.
There is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to the lower orders of creation; yet with every year I am less a fisherman, though without more humanity or even wisdom; at present I am no fisherman at all.
But I see that if I were to live in a wilderness I should again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest.
I thought, as I have my living to get, and have not eaten today, that I might go a-fishing.
Shall I go to heaven or a-fishing?
