I got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn.
CHAPTER THE BEAN-FIELD.
I came to love my rows, my beans, though so many more than I wanted.
What shall I learn of beans or beans of me?
Soon, however, the remaining beans will be too tough for them, and go forward to meet new foes.
Removing the weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of grassthis was my daily work.
As I had little aid from horses or cattle, or hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I was much slower, and became much more intimate with my beans than usual.

They were beans cheerfully returning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and my hoe played the Ranz des Vaches for them.
It was a singular experience that long acquaintance which I cultivated with beans, what with planting, and hoeing, and harvesting, and threshing, and picking over and selling themthe last was the hardest of all-

Not that I wanted beans to eat, for I am by nature a Pythagorean, so far as beans are concerned, whether they mean porridge or voting, and exchanged them for rice; but, perchance, as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes and expression, to serve a parable-maker one day.
I harvested twelve bushels of beans.
What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year?
These beans have results which are not harvested by me.
