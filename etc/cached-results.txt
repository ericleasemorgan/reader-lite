Holding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector, and menaced him saying," Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lionhearted Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men.
The Embassy to Achilles.
Then Achilles took his seat facing Ulysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus offer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.
" Achilles answered," Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you formal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no more of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come.
And Nestor knight of Gerene answered," Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits.
" Ulysses smiled at him and answered," You had indeed set your heart upon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are hardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles himself, whose mother was an immortal.
" And Ulysses answered," Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these, for the gods are far mightier than we are.
Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses were making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by the Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to Ulysses who was beside him," Great Hector is bearing down upon us and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.
" With these words he struck the shield of Ulysses.
And Achilles answered," Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who it is that he is bearing away wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but I could not see his face for the horses went by me at full speed."
Agamemnon proposes that the Achaeans should sail home, and is rebuked by Ulysses—Juno beguiles Jupiter—Hector is wounded.
Achilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector will kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon.
Then Patroclus drew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some spring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.
Hector sprang also from his chariot to the ground.
Poor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying,' Come not back to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body.'
Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked body— for Hector holds his armour." A dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened.
" Ulysses answered," Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the Achaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater knowledge.
Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans and declared that he would fight Achilles.
Achilles struck him full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and split it clean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him saying," You be low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your father 's estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus."
Achilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a fawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts through glade and thicket.
Achilles made signs to the Achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dart at Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come in second.
Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said," Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to the ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lust of battle.
Hector saw it coming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over his head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it up and gave it back to Achilles without Hector 's seeing her; Hector thereon said to the son of Peleus," You have missed your aim, Achilles, peer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom, though you made sure that he had done so.
" As he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like a soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or timid hare— even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon Achilles.
Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades.
" Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses, full of wiles, rose also.
Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him; Ulysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire of watching them, Ajax said to Ulysses," Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between us.
Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in spite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him save only Achilles."
A man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost— a son, it may be, or a brother born from his own mother 's womb; yet when he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain noble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade.
The lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles.
" Achilles looked at him sternly and said," Vex me, sir, no longer; I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector.
Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said," Ulysses I beseech you have mercy upon me and spare me.
